    overview: "Code reviews are a critical part of the software development lifecycle, but they often create bottlenecks and are prone to human error when reviewers are fatigued. To solve this, I built an end-to-end automated Pull Request review system integrated directly into GitHub. Using a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model hosted via Ollama, the system acts as a strict, automated security engineer. It scans incoming git diffs, detects vulnerabilities, and leaves precise line-by-line comments on the PR, drastically reducing the manual review burden while maintaining a high recall rate for security flaws.",

Using the Unsloth framework and QLoRA for maximum training efficiency, the model was trained on an Alpaca-style prompt format. It learns to ingest raw unified git diffs and strictly output a specific JSON schema containing the target commit, the review action (APPROVE, REQUEST_CHANGES, or COMMENT), and an array of inline comments with custom severity tags (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)."

Rather than using a standard Personal Access Token, it operates as a custom GitHub App, dynamically generating 1-hour Installation Tokens via JWTs to bypass restrictions against self-approving PRs. To handle GitHub's strict 10-second webhook timeout, the backend processes incoming payloads asynchronously. It immediately returns a 200 OK status while offloading the diff retrieval and LLM inference to a background thread."

        body: "Bridging the gap between a probabilistic LLM and the rigid GitHub API required robust defensive programming. I engineered several guardrails at the Data Transfer Object (DTO) level. 'The Line Number Rescue' automatically intercepts and fixes hallucinatory line keys. The 'Flattened JSON Repair' rebuilds broken array structures, and the 'Custom Severity Injection' embeds the AI's custom tags directly into Markdown. Crucially, the 'Bipolar Logic Override' checks the AI's sentiment: if the text summary is overwhelmingly positive but triggers a REQUEST_CHANGES event, the system automatically downgrades it to a harmless COMMENT to prevent unjustified pipeline blocks."

It features an interactive 'Deep Dive Viewer' that parses the nested JSON model outputs, color-coding the custom severity tags to help developers audit the AI's logic file-by-file and monitor for inference degradation."

By separating the core application runtime from the persistent storage, the system ensures that the application containers can be destroyed, updated, or rebuilt without any data loss or interruption to the underlying database files. The underlying host is a headless Linux distribution, ensuring maximum system resources are allocated strictly to the container runtime rather than a graphical desktop[cite: 1]."

This architectural shift dramatically reduced application-layer latency and resolved proprietary codec incompatibilities."

This ensured the database accurately indexed real-time file states and successfully generated previews without relying on outdated failure logs. Redis specifically handled transactional file locking and memory caching to prevent UI bottlenecking during transfers[cite: 1]."
